<h3>Abstract</h3>
Bone homeostasis is regulated by hormones such as parathyroid hormone (PTH). While PTH can stimulate osteo-progenitor expansion and bone synthesis, how PTH-signaling intensity in progenitors is controlled is unclear. Endochondral bone osteoblasts arise from perichondrium-derived osteoprogenitors and hypertrophic chondrocytes (HC). We found, via single-cell transcriptomics, HC descendent cells activate membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) and the PTH pathway as they transition to osteoblasts in neonatal and adult mice. Unlike Mmp14 global knockouts, HC lineage-specific Mmp14 null mutants (Mmp14ΔHC) produce more bone. Mechanistically, MMP14 cleaves the extracellular domain of PTH1R, dampening PTH signaling and PTH signaling is enhanced in Mmp14ΔHC mutants. We found HC-derived osteoblasts contribute ~50% of osteogenesis promoted by treatment with PTH 1-34 and this response was amplified in Mmp14ΔHC. MMP14 control of PTH signaling likely applies also to both HC- and non- HC-derived osteoblasts because their transcriptomes are highly similar. Our study identifies a novel paradigm of MMP14 activity-mediated titration of PTH signaling in the osteoblast lineage, contributing new insights into bone metabolism with therapeutic significance for bone-wasting diseases.
